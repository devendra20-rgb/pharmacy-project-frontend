      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Your brain is the most energy-demanding organ in your body, using about 20% of your daily caloric intake. Feeding it the right nutrients is crucial for optimal cognitive function, memory, and mood regulation.</p>
      
      <h2>Top Brain-Boosting Foods</h2>
      <h3>1. Fatty Fish</h3>
      <p>Rich in omega-3 fatty acids, fish like salmon, trout, and sardines provide DHA, a crucial component of brain cell membranes. Studies show omega-3s may reduce age-related cognitive decline and lower Alzheimer's risk.</p>
      
      <h3>2. Blueberries</h3>
      <p>Packed with anthocyanins and antioxidants, blueberries have been shown to improve communication between brain cells and may delay short-term memory loss.</p>
      
      <h3>3. Nuts and Seeds</h3>
      <p>Walnuts, almonds, and pumpkin seeds contain vitamin E, which protects brain cells from oxidative stress. Just one ounce daily may improve cognitive function.</p>
      
      <h2>The Mediterranean Diet Connection</h2>
      <p>Research consistently shows that following a Mediterranean-style diet rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and healthy fats is associated with better brain health and reduced dementia risk.</p>
      
      <h2>Foods to Limit</h2>
      <p>Refined sugars, trans fats, and excessive alcohol can impair brain function and increase inflammation. Moderation is key.</p>
